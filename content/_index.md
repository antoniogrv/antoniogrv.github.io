Ciao!

I'm Antonio, an Italy-based computer scientist currently working as a <strong>Core Site Reliability Engineer II</strong> at [Prima](https://www.helloprima.com/). Previously, I worked as a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer at [Leonardo](https://www.leonardo.com/en/).

I spend most of my time building and operating reliable cloud-native infrastructures both on-prem and on AWS, with a strong focus on Kubernetes, networking, observability and cybersecurity. I also hold a Master's Degree in Cybersecurity, and while my role today is less programming-oriented, I’m still quite passionate about Rust, Golang and Python.

Nothing much else to see here. But please, feel free to reach out if you want to connect!
